## Description
Xooa makes it easy to use blockchain by eliminating common barriers. By gaining an enterprise blockchain platform, you can start leveraging the capabilities of blockchain almost instantly. The Xooa Ledger Database (XLDB) allows you to use blockchain like a simple database. Storing, retrieving, and querying entries without needing to write a smart contract. All you need is a Xooa account. This connector completes the picture by providing access to this database. The current state of a given entry is represented by the World State (a NoSQL database). Because blockchain is append only, the transactions that led to the current state of the entry are stored in the ledger. An entry must take the form of key-value pair where the key uniquely identifies the entry and value can take the form of a JSON object.
