## Description
> The Office 365 Groups Mail connector allows users to work with data located in a Office 365 Group mailbox. The functionality in this connector works independently from a single user's personal mailbox and allows users to work with any Group they can access within their organization. The connector works off the Microsoft Graph API, and uses terminology specified in a Office 365 Groups documentation within the Graph API. Learn more in the connector documentation.
