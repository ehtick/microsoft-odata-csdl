## Description
The Recorded Future Identity Intelligence Connector enables security and IT teams to detect identity compromises, for both employees and customers. To do this, Recorded Future automates the collection, analysis, and production of identity intelligence from a vast range of sources. Through this connector, organizations can incorporate identity intelligence into automated workflows (e.g., password resets) with applications such as Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Sentinel.
