## Description
> The OS Places API provides a detailed view of an address and its life cycle. It contains all the records of AddressBase Premium and so provides all the information relating to an address or property from creation to retirement. It contains local authority, Ordnance Survey and Royal Mail addresses, current addresses, and alternatives for current addresses, provisional addresses (such as planning developments) and historic information.
