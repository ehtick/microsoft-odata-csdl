## Description
Business Assist connector provides a set of services to automate common customer-success tasks. Customer service leaders, managers and agent personas can use it to reliably predict service-call volumes (to manage staffing levels), cluster customer feedback (to focus on the right investments) and generate self-help solutions for Microsoft 365 product issues.  Reduce your organizationâ€™s helpdesk cost and provide great customer experience by adopting the same services that power Microsoft Support.
