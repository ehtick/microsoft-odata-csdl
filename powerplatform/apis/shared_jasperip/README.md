## Description
Jasper is an on-brand AI platform for businesses. It helps creators use generative AI to break through writerâ€™s block, create original imagery, and repackage content into different formats, tones and languages. Unlike most AI tools which are tied to individual tools and can produce pretty generic outputs, Jasper can be trained on your brand and called up on any platform you use from email to social media to your website.
