## Description
PixelMe links allow you to track customers across platforms and increase the likelihood of turning clicks into conversions. Deep links direct users straight to a particular website or app page, eliminating the need for them to navigate or re-enter billing details. PixelMeâ€™s deep links open directly in the Amazon app, allowing you to drive customers directly to the Amazon app for better UX, enhanced retention, and higher likelihood of conversion.
