## Description
> This is a legacy connector for Azure IoT Central V2 applications that will become deprecated in the future. You should use the Azure IoT Central V3 connector and applications instead. Azure IoT Central makes it easy to connect, monitor, and manage your IoT devices at scale. With the IoT Central V2 connector, you can trigger flows when a rule has fired and take action by creating new devices, updating existing devices, and deleting devices.
