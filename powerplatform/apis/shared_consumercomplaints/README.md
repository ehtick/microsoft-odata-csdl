## Description
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a U.S. government agency, ensures fair treatment by financial institutions. The Consumer Complaint Database collects and publishes complaints about financial products and services after company responses, confirmations, or 15 days. Complaints referred to other regulators, like those about institutions with assets under $10 billion, are not published. The database updates daily.
