## Description
The API will allow you to find, retrieve, and filter service customers in CDK Drive. Within CDK Drive, a customer is an individual who has been sold a vehicle, is a prospect on a vehicle, has bought parts, or has had their vehicle repaired or serviced through the dealership and exists in a CRM system. In addition, this connector will allow you to create a basic customer record. This helps service advisers provide a positive experience by allowing those workflows to be tied to a customer.
