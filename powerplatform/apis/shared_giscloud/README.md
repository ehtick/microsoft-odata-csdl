## Description
This connector allows users to use any valid authorization key generated in GIS Cloud to access a list of their Map Projects, the Layers defined within and the Features contained on those layers. To accommodate the dynamic nature of Feature schema, the connector will dynamically query the service for the feature schema of a given layer.
