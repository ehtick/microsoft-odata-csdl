## Description
Xooa makes it easy to use blockchain by eliminating common barriers. A blockchain platform as a service (PaaS) provides an enterprise blockchain. The connector provides an immutable ledger and a private blockchain infrastructure. You control who can view and participate in the ledger, and you can shift your data to your own network at any time.
