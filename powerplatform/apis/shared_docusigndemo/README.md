## Description
> DocuSign helps organizations connect and automate how they prepare, sign, act on, and manage agreements. The DocuSign Demo connector connects only to DocuSign Demo environments but offers the same functionality as the regular DocuSign connector. Any documents in a DocuSign Demo environment are not legally binding. For all non-demo uses, use the regular DocuSign connector.
